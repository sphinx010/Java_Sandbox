if statement
this would guarantee that all salesmen get a base pay of a $1,000;
for reaching the 10 sales quota
and where they sell above the quota, they'll receive a $250.00 bonus pay
so the if statement would ensure that where the sales are less than the quota, the salesmen get nothing,
and where the sales are above the quota, the salesmen get a reward $$ðŸ¤‘
